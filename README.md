# PasswordVault
This is a command line application that helps users store their passwords to various accounts/services. This application can be made to run on start-up of your system for a better user experience.

# How this works?
The user can interact with the program using simple commands on their terminal. Your passwords will be saved to SQLite database which is protected by one master password. The user can enter their already created passwords or they can make the program create a password for them using a custom password generator that creates passwords that takes 50+ years for a computer to crack.
